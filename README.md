# React Guessing (猜数字游戏)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
这是个学习的产物，学习React的过程中，用React实现了一次猜数字游戏。

## Demo

The [Demo](https://bobgame.github.io/ReactGuessing/demo/index.html).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
